To help understand our intuition and rationale for our motion-aware mechanism, we showcase visualization of game video generated by our world models and ground truth mask generated by the adaptive Gaussian mixture model on both the Atari 100k benchmark and DeepMind Control Suite benchmark. 

We will release our code to promote future work to equip our **motion-aware mechanism**.
